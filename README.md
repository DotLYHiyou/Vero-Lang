# Vero
A programmming language. Source, syntax, compiler and parser tbd.
# Future Syntax (Subject to Change)
Printing text to the console:
```vero
addlog("Hello World")
```
Printing a variable.
```vero
x == 6
addlog(x)
```
# Future Installation
I think in the future you might have to get Node.js and _Then_ install Vero, but thats for another time.
